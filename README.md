**MAJOR PROJECT**

**THEME: Social Media and Social Networking Analytics**

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Predictive Model for User Engagement**

The widespread use of social media and social networking platforms has created vast amounts of data that hold valuable insights about user behavior, preferences, and interactions. Businesses, marketers, and content creators are constantly seeking ways to enhance their engagement with users, reach a broader audience, and improve the effectiveness of their online strategies. This project aims to address the following problem:

**"Develop an advanced machine learning-based analytics system for social media and social networking platforms that can predict user engagement levels with various types of content, thereby enabling businesses to optimize their content strategy and increase user interaction."**


**Project Overview**   

The Social Media Data Analysis project is a robust exploration of social media data using a variety of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques. This project dives deep into understanding social media trends, user behavior, and sentiment analysis, employing a combination of data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

**Key Components** 

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   
1.**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

2.**Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features from raw data to enhance the model's predictive power.

3.**Text Data Processing:** Tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis for textual data.


2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   
Data Visualization: Utilizing various graphs and plots to uncover patterns and trends within social media data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses and gain insights.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**

**Classification Algorithms:**

1.**Decision Tree Classifier:** Building decision tree models to classify social media posts or users based on specific features.

2.**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implementing KNN algorithms for classifying similar social media posts or users.

3.**Logistic Regression:** Employing logistic regression for binary classification tasks.

4.**Random Forest Classifier:** Utilizing ensemble learning for improved classification accuracy.

**Regression:**

1.**Linear Regression:** Applying linear regression to predict numerical values such as post engagement or user activity metrics.

2.**R² Score:** Utilizing the R² score to evaluate the regression models' goodness of fit.


**Clustering:**
**K-Means Clustering:** Grouping similar social media users or posts together based on their attributes.

**Naive Bayes Classifier:**
**Sentiment Analysis:** Implementing Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis to categorize posts or comments as positive, negative, or neutral.
